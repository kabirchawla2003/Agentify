    "query": "Which mutual funds should I start investing in?",
    "response": "To recommend specific mutual funds, I need more information about your financial situation. Here's a general approach:\n\n1.  **Determine your financial goals:** Are you saving for retirement, a down payment on a house, or another specific goal? The time horizon for your goal will influence the types of funds that are appropriate.\n2.  **Assess your risk tolerance:** Are you comfortable with the possibility of losing money in exchange for potentially higher returns, or do you prefer a more conservative approach?\n3.  **Consider your investment timeline:** How long do you have until you need the money? This will influence the types of funds that are appropriate.\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of your goals, risk tolerance, and timeline, you can start researching different types of mutual funds, such as:\n\n*   **Equity Funds:** Invest primarily in stocks and are suitable for long-term growth.\n*   **Bond Funds:** Invest primarily in bonds and are generally less volatile than equity funds.\n*   **Balanced Funds:** Invest in a mix of stocks and bonds.\n*   **Index Funds:** Track a specific market index, such as the S&P 500.\n*   **Target Date Funds:** Automatically adjust their asset allocation over time to become more conservative as you approach your target date (e.g., retirement).\n\nI recommend consulting with a financial advisor to get personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.",
